# Sentiment Analysis in Python using VADER and Hugging Face Transformers

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on text data using Python. It explores two distinct approaches:

1.  **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner):** A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It's a bag-of-words approach that relies on a dictionary of words and their associated sentiment scores.
2.  **Roberta Pretrained Model from Hugging Face Transformers:** Leveraging the power of transformer models, this approach utilizes a pretrained Roberta model (a robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach) from the Hugging Face Transformers library for more sophisticated sentiment analysis.
3.  **Hugging Face Pipeline:** This notebook also showcases the ease of use of the Hugging Face `pipeline` for sentiment analysis, which provides a high-level abstraction over pretrained models.

This notebook closely follows the concepts presented in [Rob Mulla's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpzMWQvxXWk) YouTube video on sentiment analysis.

## Methods

### 1. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner)

* **Approach:** VADER employs a sentiment lexicon, which is a list of words and their valence (positive or negative) scores. It also incorporates grammatical and syntactical conventions that express sentiment intensity (e.g., exclamation marks, capitalization, degree modifiers).
* **Strengths:** VADER is computationally inexpensive and performs well on social media text, including emoticons and slang.
* **Implementation:** The notebook will likely use the `nltk.sentiment.vader` module to analyze the sentiment of text data.

### 2. Roberta Pretrained Model from Hugging Face Transformers

* **Approach:** This method utilizes a pretrained Roberta model, which has been trained on a massive corpus of text data. Transformer models like Roberta understand the context of words within a sentence, leading to more accurate sentiment predictions, especially for complex or nuanced language.
* **Strengths:** Roberta excels at understanding context and can capture more subtle sentiment nuances compared to lexicon-based approaches.
* **Implementation:** The notebook will use the `transformers` library from Hugging Face to load a pretrained Roberta model (likely fine-tuned for sentiment analysis) and apply it to the text data.

### 3. Hugging Face Pipeline

* **Approach:** The Hugging Face `pipeline` provides a simple and efficient way to use pretrained models for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. It handles the underlying complexities of tokenization, model loading, and prediction.
* **Strengths:** Extremely easy to use and allows for quick experimentation with state-of-the-art models.
* **Implementation:** The notebook will demonstrate how to use the `sentiment-analysis` pipeline from the `transformers` library.

## Dataset

This notebook uses the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset, available on Kaggle ([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)).

* **Data:** The dataset contains a large number of customer reviews for fine food products sold on Amazon.
* **Usage in Notebook:** The notebook loads the dataset using pandas and, for demonstration purposes, initially works with the first 500 rows of the dataset. You can modify this to analyze a larger portion or the entire dataset.

## Steps to Run the Notebook

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * **Python 3:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
    * **Jupyter Notebook:** You will need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the `.ipynb` file.
    * **Kaggle Account (Optional but Recommended):** If you intend to run the notebook directly on Kaggle, you'll need a Kaggle account.

2.  **Installation:**
    * **Clone or Download the Notebook:** Obtain the Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) and any associated files.
    * **Install Required Libraries:** Open your terminal or command prompt and install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

        ```bash
        pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk transformers
        ```

    * **Download NLTK Resources:** The notebook imports the `nltk` library. You might need to download specific resources like `word_tokenize` and `vader_lexicon`. Run the following in a Python interpreter or a Jupyter Notebook cell:

        ```python
        import nltk
        nltk.download('punkt')
        nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
        ```

3.  **Dataset Setup (If Running Locally):**
    * If you are running the notebook locally, you need to download the `Reviews.csv` file from the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset on Kaggle.
    * Place the `Reviews.csv` file in a location accessible to your notebook, and update the `datasetPath` variable in the notebook to point to the correct file path.

4.  **Running the Notebook:**
    * **Open Jupyter Notebook:** Navigate to the directory containing the notebook in your terminal and run:

        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```

        or

        ```bash
        jupyter lab
        ```

    * **Execute Cells:** Open the `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` file in your Jupyter environment. Run the notebook cells sequentially by selecting a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter` or by using the "Run" button in the toolbar.

5.  **Observe the Output:** The notebook will execute the code for each sentiment analysis technique and display the results, including:
    * Loading and displaying a sample of the dataset.
    * Basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 'Score' column.
    * Demonstration of basic NLTK functionalities like tokenization and part-of-speech tagging (though this might not be directly related to sentiment analysis in the final steps).
    * Implementation and results of sentiment analysis using VADER.
    * Implementation and results of sentiment analysis using the Roberta pretrained model from Hugging Face.
    * Implementation and results of sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face `pipeline`.

## Dependencies

* **Python:** `>= 3.6`
* **NumPy:** `>= 1.20`
* **Pandas:** `>= 1.3`

* **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** `>= 3.6`
* **Hugging Face Transformers:** `>= 4.15`

## Further Exploration

This notebook provides a foundational understanding of sentiment analysis using different techniques. You can further explore:

* **Preprocessing:** Experiment with different text preprocessing steps like removing stop words, stemming, or lemmatization to see their impact on the results, especially for VADER.
* **Model Fine-tuning:** For the Roberta model, consider fine-tuning it on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset for potentially better performance on this specific domain.
* **Evaluation:** Implement proper evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to quantitatively compare the performance of the different sentiment analysis methods. You would need labeled data for this.
* **Analyzing Different Columns:** Apply sentiment analysis to other text columns in the dataset, such as 'Summary'.
* **Visualizations:** Create more insightful visualizations to understand the distribution of sentiment across different product scores or other categories.
* **Handling Imbalance:** Address the class imbalance in the 'Score' column (as observed in the EDA) if you were to build a classification model based on sentiment.
